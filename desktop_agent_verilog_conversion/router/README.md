# Per-task LLM router for Verilog -> TL-Verilog conversion

A programmatic driver for the conversion flow in this repo: one stateless
API call per attempt, a cheap model first with escalation, and formal
equivalence checking as the only gate. This is the primary conversion
workflow; the desktop agent flow described in `../README.md` remains
supported.

## Relationship to the desktop agent flow

Genuinely shared:

- `../instructions/desktop_agent_instructions.md` is the core of the cached
  common guide sent to every worker. The router wraps it with
  `guide_preamble.md` (the worker's role in the routed flow) and
  `guide_appendix.md` (a condensed TL-Verilog reference) at startup, so
  instruction updates land in both flows without duplication.
- `../scripts/fev.sh` and the other scripts run inside the container through
  each module dir's `scripts/` link; the router never carries its own copy.
- The Docker toolchain image is built from
  `../conversion_setup/env/Dockerfile.fev` (or the full agent image from
  `Dockerfile` in the same directory).

Router-specific: the routing loop (`router.py` + `lib/`), per-task judge
criteria (`checks/`), a reference hint set (`hints_examples/`), a `timeout`
shim (`toolshim/`) that widens fev.sh's SandPiper timeout for slower
machines, and the task definitions themselves (`tasks/`): these are copies
of the tasks in `../instructions/conversion_tasks.md`, one file per task,
not references, so an edit there must be mirrored here.

## Why it is cheap

1. Every attempt is a fresh call built as three blocks: the common guide
   (identical across all tasks and modules), the task + current files
   (identical across retries within a task), and the latest feedback. Cache
   breakpoints sit after the first two blocks, so retries are mostly cache
   reads.
2. deepseek attempts each task first; claude only sees tasks deepseek failed.
3. The full shared instructions ride along in the cached prefix, so nothing
   is re-sent at full price.

## What keeps it honest

- fev.sh must print "All FEV runs successful" for a task to advance. No
  exceptions; the router never edits harness files, and models cannot either
  (HARNESS_FILES blocklist).
- An oversight judge (separate LLM call, skeptical system prompt) checks the
  refactoring INTENT after FEV passes; its FAIL reason feeds the retry loop.
  The judge sees wip.tlv before and after plus every other file the worker
  changed in that attempt, each under its own heading.
- NO_CHANGE claims are cross-checked by the next provider, then judged.
- MM_ACCEPT_GLOB / MM_ACCEPT_DISTINCT block the observed work-dodging moves
  (no files created; per-config designs byte-identical).
- attempts.jsonl records every attempt's feedback-in and full reply.

## Edit format

Workers reply with whole files in `===FILE:`/`===END===` blocks, using the
dots omission format: a line containing exactly `...` stands for an
unchanged region of the original file, applied by diff alignment. An
ambiguous `...` (mixed with changed lines in one region) fails soft to a
request for the complete file.

## Setup

1. Key files (a file containing only the key):
   - `~/.secrets/deepseek_key` (or MM_DEEPSEEK_KEY_FILE)
   - `~/.secrets/anthropic_key` (or MM_ANTHROPIC_KEY_FILE); also used by the
     judge, so needed even when the worker is deepseek or the agent.
2. The toolchain docker image, from this repo:
   `cd desktop_agent_verilog_conversion/conversion_setup/env && docker build -f Dockerfile.fev -t mm-convert:latest .`
3. A checkout of the Verilog project with tlv/<module> work dirs (each work
   dir holds wip.tlv, fev.eqy, config.json, orig.sv, prepared.sv and a
   scripts/ link into this repo). MM_LLMTLV_DIR defaults to this repo, the
   one containing the router.

The router preflights all of this and fails fast with a clear message if a
key file, the docker image, fev.sh, or the agent CLI is missing.

## Run

Works from any directory; task paths resolve relative to the order file.

```
MM_SERV_DIR=/path/to/serv \
MM_PROVIDERS="deepseek:2,claude:6" \
python3 desktop_agent_verilog_conversion/router/router.py /path/to/serv/tlv/<module_dir>
```

Tests, all dependency-free:

```
python3 tests.py        # parser cases for the edit format
python3 smoke_test.py   # imports every module, exercises preflight
python3 loop_test.py    # judge context and retry loop against fake providers
```

The router resumes: completed tasks and the in-flight attempt budget live in
`<module_dir>/e6_state.json`, so rerunning the same command continues where
it stopped (survives network drops and machine sleep; run it in tmux on a
server and your laptop is irrelevant).

## Structure

`router.py` is the entry point: argv check, config init, preflight, loop.
The implementation lives in `lib/`, one concern per module:

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| lib/config.py | every MM_* knob and shared constant, read once at import; MDIR set from argv |
| lib/prompts.py | system prompts, the composed cached common guide, per-attempt prompt assembly |
| lib/providers.py | deepseek/claude API calls with caching and retry, plus the Claude Code agent worker |
| lib/edits.py | edit-format parsing and applying: dots omissions, NO_CHANGE, justifications |
| lib/fev.py | docker invocation of the shared fev.sh and SandPiper error-context enrichment |
| lib/judge.py | the oversight judge, judge.json records, and the acceptance checks |
| lib/workspace.py | module-dir file access, status.json, attempts.jsonl and unparsed-reply logging |
| lib/accounting.py | cost and cache tracking, spend caps, run summary |
| lib/state.py | e6_state.json load/save for resume |
| lib/preflight.py | fail-fast environment checks before any paid call |
| lib/runner.py | the task loop: provider escalation, NO_CHANGE cross-check, judge routing, resume bookkeeping |

## Environment reference

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| MM_ORDER | router/tasks/order.json | task list, [name, task-file] pairs; task paths resolve relative to the order file |
| MM_PROVIDERS | deepseek:2,claude:2 | attempt budget per provider, in order |
| MM_JUDGE | 1 | oversight judge on/off |
| MM_CHECKS | router/checks | per-task judge criteria files |
| MM_HINTS | router/hints | per-task hint files, appended to the task prompt; filename = task name with every non-alphanumeric run replaced by `_`, plus `.txt` (e.g. `Non_vector_Signals.txt`) |
| MM_COMMON_GUIDE | (composed) | a single prebuilt guide file, replacing the default composition from the shared instructions |
| MM_ACCEPT_GLOB | (off) | glob whose match count must increase during the task |
| MM_ACCEPT_DISTINCT | (off) | 1 = per-config wip_*.sv must differ |
| MM_MAX_COST_DEEPSEEK / _CLAUDE | 2.0 / 5.0 | USD safety caps per run |
| MM_SERV_DIR | ./serv | docker mount for the Verilog project checkout |
| MM_LLMTLV_DIR | this repo | docker mount for the LLM_TLV checkout (fev.sh harness) |
| MM_TOOLSHIM_DIR | router/toolshim | docker mount for the timeout shim |
| MM_DOCKER_IMAGE / MM_DOCKER_USER | mm-convert:latest / (none) | toolchain container |
| MM_DEEPSEEK_KEY_FILE / MM_ANTHROPIC_KEY_FILE | ~/.secrets/... | API key file paths |
| MM_AGENT_CMD / MM_AGENT_MODEL | claude / sonnet | agent worker CLI and model |
| MM_AGENT_MAX_TURNS / MM_AGENT_TIMEOUT | 40 / 900 | agent worker limits |

## Agent worker mode

`MM_PROVIDERS="agent:2"` (or e.g. `"deepseek:2,agent:2"`) replaces the raw
API worker with Claude Code running headless in the module directory: the
agent edits the design files directly with file tools only (no shell), so
the edit format does not apply at all. Harness files are snapshotted before
every attempt and force-restored if touched, fev.sh and the judge gate
exactly as for API workers, and every attempt's report still lands in
attempts.jsonl. Requires the `claude` CLI installed and logged in
(subscription usage, no API cost for the worker; the judge still uses the
anthropic key file). This is the direction of issue #8: programmatic
sequencing with an agentic refactor step.

## Hierarchy combining plan (pre-step)

`plan.py` is a design-level pre-step, run once per design before converting
any module:

```
python3 desktop_agent_verilog_conversion/router/plan.py /path/to/design/rtl [top_module] [--no-llm] [--out <dir>]
```

It surveys every module in the design (a pure-Python parse of declarations
and instantiations, good enough for hierarchy surveying, no yosys needed)
and proposes a per-module combining strategy. Mechanical facts decide the
defaults: the top module stays a module; a module instantiated twice or
more becomes a macro (with config knobs when its parameters differ across
sites); a single-use module is inlined as a TLV scope named `/<module>`,
since full flattening maximizes code reduction. One cheap-first LLM call
(same providers as the router; `--no-llm` skips it) annotates each module
with a generic-vs-structural judgment and may upgrade an inline to a macro.
The proposal is printed as a table; interactively the user overrides
strategies (`<module>=module|macro|inline`) and names synthesis-boundary
modules (`synth <module>`), which cannot be auto-detected and default to
none. EOF or a non-tty accepts the defaults, so it also runs unattended.

The accepted plan is persisted as collateral in the design dir (or
`--out`): `combining_plan.json` records per-module strategy,
instantiation count, reason, and whether the user overrode it, plus the
synthesis boundaries; `combining_plan.md` is the same content readable.
The combining tasks (Combine Repeated Logic / Inline Child Macros)
consult this file for the strategy to apply to each module.

Test: `python3 plan_test.py` (self-contained, no network).

## Hints: the ratchet

When a task fails its whole attempt budget, the run stops. Write what you
learned into `hints/<Task_Name>.txt` (attempts.jsonl holds every failed
exchange; verify fixes by hand through fev.sh before turning them into a
hint) and rerun; the hint file is appended to the task prompt as additional
guidance. `hints_examples/serv_immdec/` is a reference hint set from a
completed serv_immdec conversion, showing the style: state why the attempts
failed, give the verified pattern byte-exact, and say explicitly what not
to touch.
