#!/bin/bash

# A supporting script for the instructions in instructions/desktop_agent_instructions.md.

# Usage: ./fev.sh
# Run from the directory containing the TLV file(s).

# This script involves four idempotent steps, performed atomically.
# Any of these four steps that have already been completed will be skipped or safely repeated
# until all have succeeded.
# All work is done in a temporary directory, and captured on success after each step.
# match_lines.eqy lists signal/pipesignal mappings for incremental FEV and serves
# also as an indication of which steps have been completed.
#
# Steps are:
# - SandPiper
#   - Run SandPiper on wip.tlv for all configurations, defining the Verilog files against which
#     FEV is run.
# - Incremental FEV:
#   - Map pipesignal paths in fev.eqy [match ...] section to signal paths (using SandPiper)
#   - Run eqy with updated fev.eqy.
# - Update fev_full Matches
#   - Incorporating match_lines.eqy into fev_full*.eqy
# - Full FEV
#   - Map pipesignal paths in fev_full*.eqy [match ...] sections to signal paths (using SandPiper)
#   - Run eqy for fev_full*.eqy, verifying wip*.sv vs. prepared.sv for various parameter values.
#
# These update local files (match_lines.eqy, feved.tlv, and *.sv) on success (or repeatably)
# as follows:
# - SandPiper:
#   - wip.tlv -> wip_*.sv (for all `config.json` M5_configs, or `wip.sv` if none)
#   - wip.sv (from SandPiper if no M5_configs, or as a symlink to the corresponding wip_*.sv)
# - Incremental FEV:
#   - match_lines.eqy is extracted from fev.eqy
#   - [DISABLED--PROBLEMATIC] wip.tlv is made read-only
#   - feved.tlv is updated from wip.tlv (and feved.sv from wip.sv)
# - Update fev_full Matches:
#   - match_lines.eqy is emptied
# - Full FEV:
#   - [DISABLED--PROBLEMATIC] wip.tlv is made writable again after passing fev_full.eqy (fev_full_*.eqy may still fail and
#     could need wip.tlv changes)
#   - match_lines.eqy is removed
#   - fully_feved.tlv is updated from wip.tlv (and all *.sv are copied in `full_sv/` for reference)
#
# They update history/#/ with:
# - SandPiper: nothing
# - Incremental FEV: `wip.tlv`, `feved.tlv`, and `fev.eqy`, `status.json`
# - Update fev_full Matches: nothing
# - Full FEV: `fev_full*.eqy` and `prepared.sv` (as a symlink), `status.json`
